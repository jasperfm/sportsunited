Then its half time. 10 minutes after the start Haaland scores for Man City with a header and its over Raya for his 19th goal of the season. 38 seconds after restart: Thomas Party scores as he receives the ball outside of the box on the right and shoots and gets it in the left side of the net for his 3rd goal of the season. 2-1 for Arsenal. Only six minutes later Lewis-Skelly scores for Arsenal. Rice does a through pass to Lewis-Skelly  from the left cut into Stone and wraps a curling ball on goal and scores to his 1st Premier league goal ever. 3-1 Arsenal. 68th minute .

       <li>Match Review<br>
          Yesterday at 20:45 Bayer Leverkusen lifted the DFB Pokal  into the late night Berliner sky for the second time ever.This year Bayer has been playing really well they have won the Bundesliga and were in the europa league final but lost. This is the time line of the match yesterday.
          It stated at 19:00 in the 3rd minute Kossounou ( Bayer Leverkusen ) got a yellow card for  barging  someone out of the way. After that nothing really  happened untill the 16 minute were Xhaka shoots from far and scores for Leverkusen! The score is now 1:0. For the second half of the first half Kaiserslautern was dominating the game they were playing good passes but Bayer always stop them. Then in the 44 minute Kossunou gets a red card for stepping onto the foot from Tomiks . Then it was half time after half time there were a lot of substitutes for Bayer Leverkusen Adli and Stanisic came for Hofmann and Schick and for Kaiserslautern  Ache came for Hanslik. In the second half Kaiserslautern had more possession of the ball then in the first half but they had trouble converting there chances. Bayer Leverkausen’s defense was solid although one of their defender were send off. They even could’ve  scored on a few counter attacks, but Frimpong lost his footing in several crucial moments. At the end Bayer Leverkusen crowned their session with the double.
